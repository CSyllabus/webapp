Indeed, the aim is to exploit the specific peculiarities of the various types of resources to achieve high-performance while leveraging power/energy consumption or other system-level aspects. However, system heterogeneity implies a relevant complexity in the usage of such a system to run a given workload, in terms of programmability (how to code an application to run on different resources) and runtime resource management (how to decide at runtime which processing unit to use for the application execution and how to tune architectural/execution parameters). To identify an optimal solution, system architects need to take into account the efficiency of systems' processing units, as well as the current workload and the working conditions.This course introduces students to the concept of Heterogeneous System Architectures (HSAs). First hardware and architectural aspects will be discussed, by presenting the overall architecture of an HSA and of the contained processing resources; in particular, we will give an overview of the organization of modern CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators (in particular FPGAs), and of the communication and memory infrastructure by discussing relevant aspects, such as memory hierarchies, cache coherency and virtual memory issues. Then, we will cover the software stack by discussing its main opportunities and challenges in resources' programmability and management. We will present the OpenCL programming paradigm and then provide some hints on the holistic solution for resource programmability and runtime management proposed by the HSA Foundation. Finally, an overview industrial and academic solutions for runtime resource management will be introduced; we will present the overall resource management framework and will discuss some state-of-the-art adaptation policies aimed at addressing different kinds of trade-off between application performance requirements and system's ones, in terms of energy/power consumption, resource utilization, temperature or lifetime reliability."}}, {"pk": 2478, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 747, "program": 37, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 747, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Discrete Optimization", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": ""}}, {"pk": 2479, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 748, "program": 37, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 748, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Algebra And Mathematical Logic", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "Relations and maps: Relations of arity 2, properties and closure of a relation with respect to a given set of properties.

This course aims at presenting general techniques, independent from the specific application field, to design multiagent systems. In particular, the course illustrates methods for designing single agents able to take rational decisions under uncertainty and for designing systems composed of many agents, with attention to communication and interaction between the agents. The course shows also some development tools for implementing agent-based software systems. At the end of the course, the students will acquire the ability to design and develop distributed systems based on the agent paradigm."}}, {"pk": 2504, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 773, "program": 37, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 773, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Business Information Systems 2", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "The course provides a methodology for the strategic and operating planning of information technologies (IT).

After the review of some basic elements, and the presentation of a few advanced topics, in robot kinematics, the dynamic model of the manipulator will be discussed, along with its main properties. The control of the manipulator will be addressed both in terms of motion planning and in terms of feedback control. Path and trajectory planning in joint space and in Cartesian space will be presented, together with advanced topics such as kinematic and dynamic scaling of trajectories and obstacle avoidance. Concerning  the feedback control, independent joint control techniques will be first discussed, with emphasis on the role of the flexibility in the joints, then advanced model-based centralized controllers will be studied. The final part of the course will be devoted to the control of robots with external sensors, including both force sensors to control the physical interaction with the environment and vision sensors to model the environment and achieve visual servoing of the manipulator."}}, {"pk": 2506, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 775, "program": 37, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 775, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Automation And Control In Vehicles", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "Road vehicles control: active and semi-active suspensions; longitudinal dynamics control (ABS); yaw-lateral dynamics control; X-by-wire systems."}}, {"pk": 2507, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 776, "program": 37, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 776, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Distributed Software Development", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "The course will give students an insight in complexity of distributed software development.
