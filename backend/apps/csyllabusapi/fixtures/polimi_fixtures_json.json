It offers undergraduate, graduate and higher education courses in engineering, architecture and design. Founded in 1863, it is the oldest university in Milan. The Politecnico has two main campuses in Milan city, where the majority of the research and teaching activities are located, and other satellite campuses in five other cities across Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. The central offices and headquarters are located in the historical campus of Città Studi in Milan, which is also the largest, active since 1927. The university was ranked the best for Engineering and among the top big universities in Italy in the CENSIS-Repubblica Italian University rankings for 2014-2015. Student fees at the Politecnico depend on the income of the family of the student. They range between about 150 €/year and 3000 €/year. Students with good grades are granted partial or full rebates, in addition to various kinds of scholarships. Most Italian universities do not offer accommodation for their students on campus. Politecnico has a limited number of approximately 2000 beds available for students. Most students from outside the city are either commuters or renting. It is customary for students to share flats in small groups of 3 or 4 people, as rent rates are very expensive in the city.", "img": "https://csyllabus.com/images/uni_logos/polimi.png", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:05:20.945Z", "created": "2017-10-30T15:05:19.541Z"}}, {"pk": 36, "model": "csyllabusapi.program", "fields": {"created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "name": "Computer Science and Engineering", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "study_level": "undergraduate and graduate"}}, {"pk": 36, "model": "csyllabusapi.programuniversity", "fields": {"university": 2, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 36, "model": "csyllabusapi.programcity", "fields": {"city": 3, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 36, "model": "csyllabusapi.programcountry", "fields": {"country": 2, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 2336, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 605, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 2336, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 605, "university": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 605, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Foundations Of Operations Research", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "The course aims at providing the students with the modeling skills and methodological tools that are needed to model and solve a wide range of decision making problems arising in computer science and in other closely related fields.

The project selection will be performed by students, who after project presentations will indicate their preferences; matching will attempt to satisfy the majority of students while at the same time allocating students to the majority of projects. In addition, students will be asked to perform readings out of a reading list of numerous papers, and then to present (mostly orally, in some cases in written form) their personal interpretation of the reading; presentations or papers will contribute to the evaluation for the residual 2 credits. The reading list will also be provided at the beginning of class. A maximum of 40 students will be evaluated with this method, determined on a FIFO basis.

Indeed, the aim is to exploit the specific peculiarities of the various types of resources to achieve high-performance while leveraging power/energy consumption or other system-level aspects. However, system heterogeneity implies a relevant complexity in the usage of such a system to run a given workload, in terms of programmability (how to code an application to run on different resources) and runtime resource management (how to decide at runtime which processing unit to use for the application execution and how to tune architectural/execution parameters). To identify an optimal solution, system architects need to take into account the efficiency of systems' processing units, as well as the current workload and the working conditions.This course introduces students to the concept of Heterogeneous System Architectures (HSAs). First hardware and architectural aspects will be discussed, by presenting the overall architecture of an HSA and of the contained processing resources; in particular, we will give an overview of the organization of modern CPUs, GPUs and hardware accelerators (in particular FPGAs), and of the communication and memory infrastructure by discussing relevant aspects, such as memory hierarchies, cache coherency and virtual memory issues. Then, we will cover the software stack by discussing its main opportunities and challenges in resources' programmability and management. We will present the OpenCL programming paradigm and then provide some hints on the holistic solution for resource programmability and runtime management proposed by the HSA Foundation. Finally, an overview industrial and academic solutions for runtime resource management will be introduced; we will present the overall resource management framework and will discuss some state-of-the-art adaptation policies aimed at addressing different kinds of trade-off between application performance requirements and system's ones, in terms of energy/power consumption, resource utilization, temperature or lifetime reliability."}}, {"pk": 2390, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 659, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 2390, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 659, "university": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 659, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Discrete Optimization", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": ""}}, {"pk": 2391, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 660, "program": 36, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 2391, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 660, "university": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 660, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"name": "Algebra And Mathematical Logic", "ects": 5, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "semester": 1, "description": "Relations and maps: Relations of arity 2, properties and closure of a relation with respect to a given set of properties.
