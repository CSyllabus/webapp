To understand the overall circuit and find a fault, it is necessary to break it down into smaller, more easily understood units and then apply fault finding strategy. This is most important when something should be tested to find electrical fault. The students will learn to select fault finding measuring instruments, how to use them and be able to apply the techniques used for the diagnosis of faults.

Many of them manage the processes in which the timed actions are of the utmost importance. Therefore, the device drivers and the rest of the system must be adapted to meet such constraints. Such systems are usually not under the constant supervision, and are expected of them to work independently for longer periods, which require high reliability and embedded recovery mechanisms. The principal goal of the course is to use simple operating system examples for demonstrating the methods for building the system, its components and device drivers for embedded computers, and in that process develops an understanding of used mechanisms as well as to learn the building process.", "ects": 4, "english_level": 1, "semester": 2, "winsum": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2037, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2038, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 3, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2039, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 25, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2040, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 26, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2041, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 27, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2042, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 28, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2043, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 29, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "pk": 2044, "fields": {"course": 415, "program": 30, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"model": "csyllabusapi.course", "pk": 415, "fields": {"name": "Information Technology Law", "description": "Regulation of the digital environment.
