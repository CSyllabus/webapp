Electrical faults in any electrical system often origin from instance, from bad construction, bad installation, ageing, overvoltages or overheating. This faulty systems of electronic circuit are comprised of a number of smaller circuits/units connected together to perform a final function. To understand the overall circuit and find a fault, it is necessary to break it down into smaller, more easily understood units and then apply fault finding strategy. This is most important when something should be tested to find electrical fault. The students will learn to select fault finding measuring instruments, how to use them and be able to apply the techniques used for the diagnosis of faults. One of skills is basic understanding of safe working practices when carrying out fault finding activities in electrical and electronic circuits under voltage. Examples are given for fault diagnostics in electrical installations, information and communication systems faults and on-board diagnostic systems."}}, {"pk": 1289, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1290, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 3, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1291, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 25, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1292, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 26, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1293, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 27, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1294, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 28, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1295, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 29, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1296, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 262, "program": 30, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 262, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 262, "university": 1, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 262, "model": "csyllabusapi.coursefaculty", "fields": {"course": 262, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "faculty": 1}}, {"pk": 262, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"url": "", "semester": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6", "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "name": "Basics of Sound Recording and Processing", "ects": 2, "keywords": "", "english_level": 0, "level": "undergraduate and graduate", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "description": "The course objective is to introduce students to sound recording in different recording conditions as well as to frequency, amplitude and time analysis and processing of sound, with the purpose to obtain optimal sound quality.

Therefore, the Biblical theology is an excellent opportunity on FER to provide intellectually mature and responsible approach to the spiritual treasure which is to a great extent present in the foundations of European civilization and science. The task of Biblical theology at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering is on one hand to allow young professionals who have advanced in technical, mathematical and information sciences an access to the Bible that does not stay just on knowledge from childhood and school age, and also to give them freedom from fundamentalist attitudes. On the other hand, Biblical theology offers tried and tested spirituality plantations and values that can be fruitfully applied in their personal lives as well as in professional and social ethics. The methodology of Biblical Theology is well-established: a systematic and precise analysis of the structure, content and the message of biblical texts, questioning their origin and effects on listeners. Classes are defined in the way that educates students to: manage the entire canonical collection of biblical books, find and read biblical texts with comprehension, find the necessary literature and present a responsible interpretation. Classes should provide a basic insight into the original language of the Bible and also in contemporary exegetical methods."}}, {"pk": 1764, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 356, "program": 20, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 356, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 356, "university": 1, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 356, "model": "csyllabusapi.coursefaculty", "fields": {"course": 356, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "faculty": 1}}, {"pk": 356, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"url": "", "semester": 2, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "name": "Electric Drives", "ects": 4, "keywords": "", "english_level": 1, "level": "graduate", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "description": "Historical development, overview and classification of electric drives.

Functional programming languages allow for the development of robust, concise programs in a short amount of time. The key advantages are higher-order functions as an abstraction mechanism and an advanced type system for safety and reusability. The course teaches basic functional programming in Haskell and the basic functional programming concepts. The course starts with language constructs and data types, moves to higher-order functions and algebraic data types, and concludes with IO data streams and monads. Students gain practical experience by solving numerous programming tasks given during the lectures and as take-home assignments. The goal of the course is not only to teach a new programming language, but also to teach a new programming paradigm and a radically different and mathematically sophisticated approach to programming."}}, {"pk": 1956, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 390, "program": 10, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 1957, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseprogram", "fields": {"course": 390, "program": 14, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 390, "model": "csyllabusapi.courseuniversity", "fields": {"course": 390, "university": 1, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z"}}, {"pk": 390, "model": "csyllabusapi.coursefaculty", "fields": {"course": 390, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "faculty": 1}}, {"pk": 390, "model": "csyllabusapi.course", "fields": {"url": "", "semester": 3, "created": "2017-10-30T15:07:40.122Z", "name": "Energy-Economy Models for Developing of Energy Systems", "ects": 4, "keywords": "", "english_level": 3, "level": "graduate", "modified": "2017-10-30T15:07:41.673Z", "description": "Energy, economic and environmental characteristics important in planning of: thermal power plants (typical technologic and economic features, environmental impact), hydro power plants (statistics of hydrological conditions probability, construction costs of hydro power plants, parameter method of cost evaluation) and nuclear power plants.

This course introduces the most important deep discriminative and generative models with a special focus on practical implementations. Part one introduces key elements of classical feed-forward neural networks and overviews basic building blocks, regularization techniques and learning procedures which are specific for deep models. Part two considers deep convolutional models and illustrates their application in image classification and natural language processing. Part three is devoted to generative deep models and their applications in vision and text representation. Finally, Part four considers sequence modelling with deep recurrent models and illustrates applications in natural language processing.
