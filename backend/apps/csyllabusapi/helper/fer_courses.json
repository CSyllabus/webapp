Meetings and negotiations are used daily in group work and collaboration, so students learn to recognize them in time, prepare for them well and execute them effectively. Through the exercises, they learn listening and talk actively; to perceive causes of misunderstanding and conflicts between people and learn how to avoid and resolve them. An important part of engineers  education is to introduce themselves via the curriculum vitae and to understand, appreciate and respect cultural differences and norms.",

Electrical faults in any electrical system often origin from instance, from bad construction, bad installation, ageing, overvoltages or overheating. This faulty systems of electronic circuit are comprised of a number of smaller circuits/units connected together to perform a final function. To understand the overall circuit and find a fault, it is necessary to break it down into smaller, more easily understood units and then apply fault finding strategy. This is most important when something should be tested to find electrical fault. The students will learn to select fault finding measuring instruments, how to use them and be able to apply the techniques used for the diagnosis of faults. One of skills is basic understanding of safe working practices when carrying out fault finding activities in electrical and electronic circuits under voltage. Examples are given for fault diagnostics in electrical installations, information and communication systems faults and on-board diagnostic systems.",
